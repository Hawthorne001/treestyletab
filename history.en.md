# History

 - master/HEAD
 - 4.1.3 (2025.1.16)
   * Show tab preview panel with visible background color on macOS.
   * Size tab preview panel in the contents area correctly on macOS Retina display. (regression on 4.1.2)
 - 4.1.2 (2025.1.14)
   * Avoid unexpected white background in the content area, when the Dark theme of Firefox is chosen with activate tab preview panel.
   * Apply uniform styling of the "sound playing" button on all themes including Photon.
   * Size tab preview panel in the contents area correctly, even if privacy protection is enabled (ex. `privacy.resistFingerprinting`=`true`.)
   * Add a new expert option to configure offset of the tab preview panel, for environments with enabled privacy protection.
 - 4.1.1 (2025.1.10)
   * Switch UI direction on RTL environments (using language with right-to-left direction, like Arabian.)
 - 4.1.0 (2024.12.25)
   * Reconstruct UI of the bookmarks creation dialog to simulate behaviors of the native one more.
   * Add ability to simulate tab preview panel on vertical tabs (requires the permission to run arbitrary scripts on webpages, aka "Access yuor data for all websites.")
   * Render descendants of a collapsed tree with better appearance based on HTML list, when tab preview panel simulation is available.
   * Revoke needless optional permissions when all features requiring the permission are disabled.
   * Add a new expert option to open dropped links in background tabs with discarded state.
   * Accept dropping of tabs and links onto the new tab button, like Firefox does.
   * Update styling of the sound playing state button in tabs to match to the native one on recent versions of Firefox.
   * Show a badge on TST's toolbar button and open the initial startup page by clicking of it, when it is the first time of TST installation, as a failsafe of the suppressable notifications.
 - 4.0.25 (2024.11.11)
   * Fix disability of `get-tree` API for other addons and disability of tree view in group tabs. (regression at 4.0.24)
 - 4.0.24 (2024.10.29)
   * Never store raw URL of tabs to save user privacy. Tab URLs were stored just to associate effective favicon URLs with tabs (so they were not sent to anywhere), but today, favicon URLs are exposed to addons as data: URIs and on most cases there is no need to store effective favicon URLs. On required cases, only hashed strings are stored instead of raw URLs.
   * Never cache tree of private windows, to save user privacy.
 - 4.0.23 (2024.9.11)
   * Remove dependencies to CSS2 system colors deprecated at letely versions of Firefox.
   * Set `text/plain` drag data for shift-dragged tabs. Now you can drop tree items to any text input area.

   * Reduce misdetection of tab closing/moving operations as internal operations.
   * Open options page from group tabs, in a foreground tab with no error.
   * Use text and bg colors of tabs same to Firefox's native tab bar on Windows 11. There is a difference v.s. the native tabs: colors of sidebar UI won't become pale in inactive windows.
   * Improve integration for bookmarks creation from drag-and-dropped tabs: Save tree structure to bookmarks even if they are dragged from Friefox's native tabs, but don't create new folder if dragged with no tree structure (flat tabs) whether from native tab bar or TST's sidebar.
   * Add ability to deactivate auto-grouping of bookmarks from dropped tabs with tree structure.
   * API: Add new notification type [`try-scroll-to-activated-tab`](https://github.com/piroor/treestyletab/wiki/API-for-other-addons#suppress-auto-scrolling-to-activated-tabs) to block auto-scrolling to the activated tab.
   * API: Expose a new tab state `stuck` as a part of [tree item](https://github.com/piroor/treestyletab/wiki/API-for-other-addons#data-format). It indicates that the tab is shown as stuck on an edge of the sidebar.
   * API: Deactivate tab tooltip completely when a blank text is registered with high priority.
   * Update `nl` locale by [Vistaus](https://github.com/Vistaus). Thanks!
 - 4.0.22 (2024.8.9)
   * Fixup tree correctly after multiselected tabs are moved together by drag and drop on the horizontal tab bar or the [Move Tab Hotkeys](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/move-tab-hotkeys/).
   * Synchronize throbber animations after the sidebar is reopened.
   * Keep highlighted appearance of multiselected tabs after the sidebar is reopened.
   * Track and update overflow/underflow state correctly even if legacy overflow/underflow events are disabled completely.
   * Restore "sticky" state of tabs correctly after tree restoration without cache.
 - 4.0.21 (2024.8.4)
   * Activate tree parent based on the user configuration more certainly if possible, when multiple tabs containing active are closed by one action.
   * Allow to close a group tab opened to replace a closed parent, when it is closed repeatedly. This behavior can be deactivated and you can keep such tabs unclosable like as old versions, with setting a secret option `closeParentBehavior_replaceWithGroup_thresholdToPrevent` to `-1`.
   * Reduce flashing of the vertical scroll bar on edge cases of overflowing.
   * Don't place new child tabs opened from a pinned tab at odd location, even when there is any waiting-to-be-grouped tabs and the system is slow.
   * Keep structure of grouped tabs as possible as we can, when partial tabs in existing trees are grouped via the [`group-tabs` API](https://github.com/piroor/treestyletab/wiki/API-for-other-addons#create-new-group-from-given-tabs).
   * Suppress flashing of the scrollbar on an edge case with the Photon theme.
   * Ignore mouse clicks only on animated closing tabs more certainly, to prevent detection of those clicks as ones on the blank area of the tab bar.
   * Determine to apply multi-column layout (or don't) to the tree in a group tab more robustly, even if its appearance is modified by the user style sheet.
   * Expose expert options temporarily when the options page is opened from internal links and the referred option is hidden as an expert option.
   * Link to the suitable option to deactivate the behavior, from a group tab opened to group children of pinned tabs.
   * Don't check the checkbox to control middle-click-paste on the new tab button, when the permission is granted but internal option is still deactivated.
   * Suppress error from missing dataTransfer of drag-and-drop events.
 - 4.0.20 (2024.6.28)
   * Fix initialization failure from unhandled IndexedDB errors.
 - 4.0.19 (2024.6.24)

You can disable this behavior by setting `deferScrollingToOutOfViewportSuccessor` to `false`.
   * Activate explicitly specified successor tab if possible, after multiple tabs are moved across windows by drag-and-drop.
   * React to "Simulate Up/Down/Left/Right Key on Tree" keybaord shortcuts as tree available, even if the sidebar panel is opened in a separate window by [Tree Style Tab in Separate Window](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/tst-in-separate-window/) or someone.
   * Add ability to control temporary state of group tabs opened by API.
   * Never insert extra contents to non-tab elements in non-target windows via API, if the target window is explicitly specified.
 - 4.0.18 (2024.6.13)
   * Add "Close Duplicated Tabs" context menu command to simulate the command of Firefox 127 and later.
   * Change default shortcut to simulate arrow keys on tree for macOS: Alt-Shift-Uo/Down/Left/Right to MacCtrl-Shift-Uo/Down/Left/Right.
   * Right/down arrow keys simulation now fallbacks to "focus to the next tab" correctly while the sidebar is closed.
 - 4.0.17 (2024.6.10)
   * Fix misindentation of tabs immediately moved after opened. (regression on 4.0.16)
   * Fix misindentation of deeply nested tree on the startup. (regression on 4.0.16)
 - 4.0.16 (2024.6.9)
   * Add new keyboard shortcut slots "Simulate Up/Down/Left/Right Key on Tree" and assign default shortcuts Alt-Shift-Up/Down/Left/Right. They provide both spatial focus move on faviconized tabs and collapse/expand tree like arrow keys on tree items.
   * Add new keyboard shortcut slots "Collapse Tree or Focus to Parent Tab" and "Expand Tree or Focus to First Child Tab" to simulate Left/Right Arrow keys on tree items.
   * Wheel scrolling on pinned tabs and keyboard shortcuts to scroll the tab bar with focused pinned tab now scroll regular tabs if the container of pinned tabs is not scrollable.
   * Optimize operations to track updated overflow/underflow state.
   * Better drag and drop of tabs/trees across windows: the tree structure is kept better, temporary group tabs are kept, and moved tabs are kept discarded.

   * Reduce needless animation effects unexpectedly re-applied to tabs rendered while virtual scrolling.
   * Fix unexpected classes on tabs in the sidebar which are left by misordered operations.

   * Update `ru`, `de` and `en` locales by [vadcx](https://github.com/vadcx). Thanks!
 - 4.0.15 (2024.5.21)
   * Treat drag and drop of a parent tab to its descendant as a dragging of an individual tab and attach it to the drop position, even if the default action is configured to drag the whole tree. You can deactivate this behavior and prevent dropping of a parent tab to its descendant to turn the hidden option `moveSoloTabOnDropParentToDescendant` to `false`.
   * Don't inherit container to an opened tab if it is opened by "Open in Container Tab" => "No Container" inin the native tab context menu.
   * Never use `overflow` and `underflow` events to become compatible with Firefox 128 and later.
   * Add new keyboard shortcut slots for "Toggle Tree Collapsed" and "Toggle Tree Collapsed Recursively" commands.
   * Add a new option to show/hide TST's context menu commands on the native tab bar.
   * Become more robust for cases that tabs are opened while the initialization process.

   * Apply new-tab-command-tab behavior correctly. (regression on 4.0.12)
   * Use `GrayText` instead of `ButtonText` as the tabs border color in the "High Contrast" theme, to reduce stresses from too high contrast.
   * "Move Tab" => "Move to New Window" in the context menu on the sidebar now moves whole tree always.
   * "Move Tab" => "Move to New Window" opens a new window shifted from the source window a little.
   * Don't deactivate unrelated options even if `<all_urls>` permission is not granted.
   * Fix unexpected reloading of the sidebar panel on tab attaching/detaching.

 - 4.0.12 (2024.4.5)
   * Calculate tab dimensions more correctly. (regression on 4.0.11)
   * Fix ability to override tab size with `--tab-size`.
   * Use `ButtonText` instead of `ButtonShadow` as the tabs border color in the "High Contrast" theme, for better visibility.

   * API: Show extra tab contents on the target pinned tab correctly.
 - 4.0.10 (2024.3.21)
   * Don't shift tree structure after a restart for a major update of Firefox (See also: [how to restore correct tree from shifted tree](https://github.com/piroor/treestyletab/issues/3504#issuecomment-2010003298))
   * Show context menu items enabled by the option correctly.
 - 4.0.9 (2024.3.20)
   * Middle-click on the "New Tab" button opens a blank new tab if the clipboard is not accessible due to some reasons.

   * Suppress some non-critical errors while initializations.
   * Update `zh_CN` locale by [NightSharp](https://github.com/NightSharp). Thanks!
 - 4.0.8 (2024.3.18)

   * Introduce a secret option `outOfScreenTabsRenderingPages` to change performance balance of the virtual scrolling. Setting it to a negative value like `-1` will work almost same as TST 3.x: no virtual scrolling.
   * Optimize operations of virtual scrolling.
   * Add ability to open URL in the clipboard by middle-click on the "New Tab" button: this aims to simulate Firefox's `browser.tabs.searchclipboardfor.middleclick` option enabled by default on Linux, and there are some requirements: grant the clipboard access permission and set `dom.events.asyncClipboard.clipboardItem` to `true`.
   * Fix regressions about scrollbar's appearance on Windows 10.

   * Tabs containing sticky tabs are kept expanded when another tree is expanded, even if those tabs are stuck via API.
 - 4.0 (2024.3.7)
   * Improved performance on cases with large number of tabs. Now tabs only in the viewport are rendered.
     * Pinned tabs and unpinned (normal) tabs are now placed under separate container elements: `#pinned-tabs-container > .tabs.pinned` and `#normal-tabs-container > .virtual-scroll-container > .tabs.normal`.
     * Each rendered tab element now has `data-index` attribute corresponding to [`tabs.Tab.index`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/API/tabs/Tab#index).
     * Due to this design change, customization with CSS `counter` won't be work as expected anymore. You'll need to create something helper addon to do such customizations.
   * Introduce new context menu commands and other triggers to stick arbitrary tabs to edges of the tab bar. It is similar to "Pin/Unpin Tab" but stuck tab keeps its tree.
   * Indicate sharing state of tabs (camera, microphone and/or screen) with icons.

   * Avoid unexpected restoration of blank dialog windows by Ctrl-Shift-T on Firefox 116 and later.
   * Restore tree structure more correctly for reopened tabs which were closed at a time.
   * Lock scroll position temporary when a tree near the tab bar end is collapsed, just like as the case when tabs are closed.
   * Open local files in tabs with blob: URL when they are dropped to the tab bar, instead of simply ignored.
   * Never create needless multiple folders for bookmarks created from tabs tree.
   * Most options are now treated as expert options and hidden by default.
   * Many API improvements.
     * Introduce a new message type [`get-version`](https://github.com/piroor/treestyletab/wiki/API-for-other-addons#detecting-version-of-tst-itself) to know the version of TST itself.
     * Introduce new notification types [`tabs-rendered` and `tabs-unrendered`](https://github.com/piroor/treestyletab/wiki/API-for-other-addons#when-one-or-more-tabs-are-renderedun-rendered) to observe tabs' rendered state.
     * Introduce a new message type [`get-light-tree`](https://github.com/piroor/treestyletab/wiki/API-for-other-addons#apis-to-get-tree-information) to get [minimal tree item information](https://github.com/piroor/treestyletab/wiki/API-for-other-addons#data-format).

     * Introduce new message types [`register-auto-sticky-states` and `unregister-auto-sticky-states`](https://github.com/piroor/treestyletab/wiki/API-for-other-addons#set-locked-as-collapsed-state-of-tree) to stick tabs with specific state to tab bar adges automaitcally.
     * Introduce a new notification type [`tab-sticky-state-changed`](https://github.com/piroor/treestyletab/wiki/API-for-other-addons#when-a-tab-is-stuck-or-unstuck-tofrom-tab-bar-edges) to observe a tab is stuck or unstuck.
     * [Introduce a new option `rendered:true` for the message types `get-tree` and `get-light-tree`, to get information only about rendered tabs.](https://github.com/piroor/treestyletab/wiki/API-for-other-addons#when-one-or-more-tabs-are-renderedun-rendered)
     * Support [bulk messaging to TST (sending multiple messages at once)](https://github.com/piroor/treestyletab/wiki/API-for-other-addons#abstract) and [bulk messaging from TST (receiving multiple messages at once](https://github.com/piroor/treestyletab/wiki/API-for-other-addons#bulk-messages-from-tst) for better performance.

   * **Most of improvements at this version is sponsored by the Waterfox project / BrowserWorks Ltd. Many thanks to Alex Kontos!** ([Announcement blog entry at Waterfox project](https://www.waterfox.net/blog/waterfox-x-treestyletab/))
 - 3.9.22 (2024.1.31)
   * Fix failed initialization when an optional permission "Read and modify bookmarks" is not granted. (regression on 3.9.21)
 - 3.9.21 (2024.1.26)
   * Fix [performance regression on 3.9.20 with on-memory cache](https://github.com/piroor/treestyletab/issues/3434).

 - 3.9.20 (2024.1.18)
   * Drop support of Firefox older than 115.
   * Restructure options about new tab position control, to reduce overlapped effects of multiple options. Now you can choose "open tab as a first/last child" for each option directly.
   * Expose expert options to control behavior of new tabs opened from links and the "New Tab" command in the simulated tab context menu.
   * Use on-memory storage for the cache of sidebar contents, to prevent bloating of Firefox's session file. This means that initialization on the browser startup takes more time, and you can take the old behavior back by a new advanced option.
   * Guess tabs opened by the "New Tab" command more certainly.
   * Suppress too much RAM usage problem with some themes with animations. (See also the [bug 1875100](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1875100).)
   * Store device ID more safely for the simulated Sync feature.
   * Update `zh_CN` locale by [NightSharp](https://github.com/NightSharp). Thanks!
 - 3.9.19 (2023.11.20)

   * Deactivate "Open in New Container Tab" context menu command for tabs with unreopenable URL.
   * Use icon color same to Firefox 120.
 - 3.9.18 (2023.11.10)
   * Add context menu commands and keyboard shortcut slots "Mute/Unmute this Tree" and "Mute/Unmute Descendants".
   * Increase default interval of the heartbeat between sidebar pages and the background page from 1sec to 5sec for less CPU usage.
   * Optimize performance of updating maximum tree level on situations with disabled animation.
   * Determine color of SVG icons for the platform color mode (dark or bright), based on the CSS prefers-color-scheme feature.
   * [Update `fr` locale by cayenne17](https://github.com/piroor/treestyletab/pull/3406). Thanks!
 - 3.9.17 (2023.9.8)
   * Handle tabs internally moved by TST itself more correctly. Reduced wrong placements of tabs opened from a pinned parent on some situations.
   * Optimize initialization process of the tab context menu on the sidebar page. Reduced delayed update of menu items after the menu appears on the screen.
   * Reduced visual gap between the last tab and the new tab button in a scrollable tab bar with the Proton theme.
   * Successfully detach a tab to a new window when a tab is dragged, moved to streight left or right and dropped at undroppable location, more certainly. The operation was unexpectedly blocked by a workaround for [an old issue already fixed at Firefox 71](https://github.com/piroor/treestyletab/issues/1778).
   * Treat dropped multiselected tabs from Firefox's native tab bar as dropped tree items.
   * Update link to the list of known helper addons: now [it is an wiki page](https://github.com/piroor/treestyletab/wiki/Helper-addons-extending-functionality-of-TST).
   * Introduce a workaround for [a platform specific problem: unexpected reaction for drag events is triggered after a finished drag-and-drop actions](https://github.com/piroor/treestyletab/issues/3374).
   * API: Add new notification type [`try-collapse-tree-from-collapse-command` and `try-collapse-tree-from-collapse-all-command`](https://github.com/piroor/treestyletab/wiki/API-for-other-addons#suppress-unintentional-collapsion-of-expanded-tree-by-tst) to allow blocing of collaption of tree by commands.
   * Updated style definition of tree twisties: now their positioning can be customized with `margin` and `padding` more easily.
   * Uniform to label the feature to apply custom user style definitions as "User Style Sheet".
   * Update `ru` locale by [wvxwxvw](https://github.com/wvxwxvw). Thanks!
 - 3.9.16 (2023.7.21)
   * Reduce RAM usage around favicons.
   * Right-click on the "new tab" button now opens containers selector like recent versions of Firefox.
   * Expand ancestors tree while a tab is moved by Ctrl-PageUp/PageDown for better usability.
   * Keep tabs scroll-locked even if the cursor is moved while the last tab is being removed.
   * Keyboard shortcuts to move focus to next/previous sibling now cycles focus between sibling tabs.
   * Add a new expert option to put tabs under a group tab always, even if they are opened from a bookmark folder and already organized as a tree. On such situations TST suppresses opening a group tab, because the group tab was initially introduced just to organize flat tabs opened from a bookmark folder as a tree.
   * Attach child tab to the opener tab correctly even if the opener had no child and "when a tab is opened from existing tab, open it as: a child of the parent tab, next to the recently opened child" is chosen.
   * Create bookmark item for the first group tab correctly, if there are multiple root level group tabs in the selection.
   * Use bright border color for "drag and drop" options on the dark mode.

   * Never reload infinitely after tabs are detached from a regular window to a popup window (by [Popup window](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/popup-window/) or someone).
   * New blank tabs reoepend with the container inherited from the active tab are activated correctly.
   * Increase heartbeat interval automatically between sidebars and the controller, to prevent unexpected disconnection on cases where very large number of tabs. This introduces a side effect: the toolbar button and the keyboard shortcut to toggle the sidbar  visibility may requrie more delay when there are large number of tabs.
 - 3.9.14 (2023.3.13)
   * Better simulation of `browser.tabs.selectOwnerOnClose` on slow environment.

   * Restructure behaviors about closing and moving of a parent tab.
       * In the sidebar, now there are some permanently fixed behaviors and some configurable presets:
           * Closing a parent tab with collapsed tree: closes the entire tree.
           * Moving a parent tab with collapsed tree: moves the entire tree.
           * Moving a parent tab with expanded tree: behaves according to configurations under the section "Drag and Drop".
       * There is a preset for people using Firefox's native tab bar as an UI to operate solo tab. In this case all tab operations done outside of the sidebar (Firefox's native tab bar, keyboard shortcuts, or other addons) are treated as operations for solo tabs, not tree of tabs.
       * There is a preset for people desireing TST to control tabs as trees always. In this case all tab operations are treated same as operations in the sidebar, even if it is done on Firefox's native tab bar, keyboard shortcuts, or other addons.
       * Otherwise you can configure behaviors for each case: closing of a parent with expanded tree in the sidebar, closing of a parent with collapsed/expanded tree outside of the sidebar, moving of a parent with collapsed/expanded tree outside of the sidebar, and more options for cases with closed sidebar.
   * Better accessibility information for the sidebar. This change should help [controlling of the sidebar via speech recognition](https://github.com/piroor/treestyletab/wiki/How-to-control-Tree-Style-Tab-via-speech-recognition).
   * Add the simulated "New Tab" context menu command on tabs.
   * "Close Tabs to the Bottom" and "Close Other Tabs" context menu commands now skips collapsed descendants of the context tab.

   * Prevent inifinite toggling of the sidebar scrollbar on macOS, when there are enough number of tabs which triggers overflowing.
   * On macOS, in-tab padding is correctly applied avoiding the scrollbar covers clickable UIs. (It was applied to wrong side.)
   * Proton theme: Show container identifier line at top of pinned tabs.
   * Proton theme: Remove separator border between pinned tabs and regular tabs.
   * Apply the icon color or the text color defined by the active theme to TST's toolbar button icon, context menu icon, and the sidebar panel switcher.
   * Rebuild sidebar contents more certainly when mis-synchronization between the main process and the sidebar contents is detected.
   * Becomes to more robust around tabs reopened immediately by other addons like Temporary Containers.
   * Becomes to more robust around closing/moving of parent tabs as solo tabs.
   * Don't show needless "Send Tab to Device" simulated context menu item in the context menu on non-tab area.

   * The `as` option of the `duplicate` API respects TST's configuration about duplicated tabs by default.

     See also the next topic.
   * All new tabs opened via the `gBrowser.addTab()` method with the option `relatedToCurrent:true` or a referrer information are now basically opened as children of the current tab.

[See discussions in #197.](https://github.com/piroor/treestyletab/issues/197)
   * Updated for Nightly 12.0a1.

   * Fixed: "Fast restore" didn't work if Tab Mix Plus is installed without its custom session management.
   * Fixed: Tabs moved into existing tree didn't become member tabs of the tree. (Regression on 0.13.2011121401. If you use Tab Mix Plus or other addons to control new tab position, tree could be broken.)
 - 0.13.2011121401
   * Improved: "Fast restore" has landed. Last tree structure of tabs is restored on the startup quickly. If you see any trouble from this feature, disable it by following processes: go to "about:config" and set `extensions.treestyletab.restoreTree.level` to `0`.
   * Improved: "about:treestyletab-group" tabs (dummy tabs for grouping) now contains list of member tabs as links. You can click it to select the tab, and you can close tabs by middle-click on links.
   * Improved: When the current tab has focus, arrow keys should work like in the folder pane on Windows Explorer. Right arrow expands a collapsed tree or focuses to the first child tab. Left arrow focuses to the parent tab or collapses the tree. (*Note: if you want to focus to the tab by mouse click, you have to add a CSS rule  `.tabbrowser-tab { -moz-user-focus: normal !important; }`  to your userChrome.css.)
   * Improved: Now, "auto hide tab bar" feature correctly hides the tab bar even if plugins (ex. PDF, Flash, and so on) cover the content area. (On old versions, the tab bar was kept shown unexpectedly on such cases.) This hack is based on an invisible popup covering the content area, so, if you see any trouble from this hack, disable it by following processes: go to "about:config" and set `extensions.treestyletab.tabbar.autoHide.contentAreaScreen.enabled` to `false`.
   * Improved: "Undo Close Tree" confirmation UI is now shown immediately when a tab member of closed tree is restored by "Undo Close Tab".

   * Fixed: Linux specific style rules were not loaded unexpectedly.
   * Fixed: On Linux + GNOME3, "narrow scroll bar" was not narrow.
   * Modified: The API  `partTab()`  is renamed to  `detachTab()` . For backward compatibility, the old name is still available.
 - 0.12.2011120101
   * Improved: While you are browsing tabs by Ctrl-Tab/Ctrl-Shift-Tab, now collapsed tree is automatically expanded, if you stay there with pressed Ctrl key. (You can change the delay via a secret preference `extensions.treestyletab.autoCollapseExpandSubtreeOnSelect.whileFocusMovingByShortcut.delay`.)
   * Improved: Title of "dummy" tabs can be changed by F2 key.
   * Improved: Tooltip on a tree now reports only top 10 tabs at first, and it is expanded to scrollable tooltip automatically after a delay. (You can change the delay via a secret preference `extensions.treestyletab.tooltip.fullTooltipDelay`.)
   * Improved: Members of the tree is shown in the tooltip on the closebox in tabs.
   * Improved: Calculation about size of pinned tabs is simplified. A new boolean preference `extensions.treestyletab.pinnedTab.faviconized` is available to change pinned tabs in a vertical tab bar from "faviconized" to "regular tab".
   * Fixed: Works on Nightly 11 at 2011-11-30(PST). Now the animation management module never uses `MozBeforePaint` event.
   * Fixed: Dropped tabs were broken if they are dropped on "indent" areas.
   * Fixed: Shrunken vertical tab bar couldn't be resized by drag and drop because the tab bar was unexpectedly expanded anyway.
   * Modified: Tooltip on tree always show tree. If you like the old behavior (tooltip with tree only for collapsed tree), you can set a secret preference `extensions.treestyletab.tooltip.mode` to `1`. (`0` means "never", `2` means "always").
   * Modified: The counter in a parent tab now reports the number of all tabs in the tree including itself.
